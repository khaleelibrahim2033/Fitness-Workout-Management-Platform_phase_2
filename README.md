# FitTrack

A full-stack fitness and workout management app. The API is built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite; the responsive React/TypeScript client is built with Vite.

- Fitness goals with progress tracking, completion/overdue status, and goal notifications
- Daily activity dashboard, weekly report, monthly report, and calorie charts
- Per-user notifications, daily workout reminders, and read/unread controls
- Workout planning with an exercise library, searchable exercises, and calendar scheduling
- Weekly and monthly progress comparisons, daily streaks, and milestone badges
- Personalized dashboard with daily activity, upcoming plans, goals, streak, and achievements

## Run locally

### API

```powershell
cd backend
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:8000`; interactive API documentation is at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. Swagger groups endpoints into Authentication, Workouts, Workout Plans, Exercises, Progress, Reports, Goals, Achievements, Dashboard, Notifications, and System sections. In production, set `APP_ENV=production` and provide a strong, unique `JWT_SECRET_KEY`. The development secret is not suitable for deployment.

### Frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:5173`. During development, `/api` requests are proxied to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. To point it at another API origin, define `VITE_API_URL` (for example, `http://localhost:8000/api`) before starting Vite. Set `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` on the API to the frontend origin; multiple comma-separated origins are supported.
